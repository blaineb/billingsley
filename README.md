# billingsley
My minimal(ish) CSS Framework


## CSS
### normalise.css
Taken from https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/, though edited for brevity.  Resets styles to be consistent across browsers.

### billingsley.css
Mostly taken from https://www.getskeleton.com, though changed significantly:
1. Moved the layout to a flex-based system.  I find this helps with some of the common layouts I try to do.
2. Removed margins and other default stylings.  I find it easier to add these as needed than rely on them (or have to undo them) when they get in the way.

## Javascript
Collection of various components and plugins I use frequently.  Again, the idea is to include a lot so you don't have to go digging around for them.  You can always delete them.

## Markup
Basic index.html layout, along with some very basic markup components.
